# Geometry Tools in Java ðŸ§®

This project contains basic Java programs to calculate the **area**, **perimeter**, **surface area**, and **volume** of common 2D and 3D shapes.

Each shape is implemented as a separate Java class, using modular methods and formatted output.

## âœ… Shapes Included:

| Shape     | Formulas Used                            |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Square**   | Area = sideÂ², Perimeter = 4 Ã— side        |
| **Rectangle**| Area = length Ã— width, Perimeter = 2(l + w) |
| **Circle**   | Area = Ï€rÂ², Circumference = 2Ï€r, Diameter = 2r |
| **Triangle** | Area = Â½ Ã— base Ã— height                  |
| **Sphere**   | Volume = (4/3)Ï€rÂ³, Surface Area = 4Ï€rÂ²    |
| **Cylinder** | Volume = Ï€rÂ²h, Surface Area = 2Ï€r(h + r)  |
